\section{Why this topic?}
Augmented Reality (AR) is the middle ground between the Real and the Virtual world.
AR is an experience where designers use computer-generated input to augment parts of the user's physical world. Designers create inputs from sound to video, graphics to GPS overlays, and more into digital content that responds in real-time to user environment changes.
I chose the Augmented Reality topic because this field is very immersing. The field of immersive experiences allows people to join an enhancing activity.

\section{Why is this relevant?}
Augmented reality is important because it can be applied in any domain. It is widely used in aircraft, military devices, and combat training to head-up car displays and smartphone games.

\section{What is the novelty factor?}


\section{What are some general goals?}
The goal is to develop a working mobile application that allows users to scan a QR and use the camera of the smartphone to visualize a 3D model of an object, follow a guide, and complete assembling that objects in the real world.

\section{What is my contribution?}
My contribution is applying my knowledge and experience to develop a mobile application that uses an AR module to scan a QR code and load a 3D model and a guide into the user's smartphone.
