\section{Why this topic?}
Augmented Reality (AR) is the middle ground between the Real and the Virtual world.
AR is an experience where designers use computer-generated input to augment parts of the user's physical world. Designers create inputs from sound to video, graphics to GPS overlays and more into digital content that responds in real-time to user environment changes.
I chose the Augmented Reality topic because this field is very immersing. This field of immersive experiences allows people to join enhancing activities.

\section{Why is this relevant?}
Augmented reality is important because it can be implemented and used in any domain. This technology is commonly utilized in various applications such as aviation, military equipment, combat training, displaying information on car windshields and gaming on smartphones.

\section{What is the novelty factor?}


\section{What are some general goals?}
The goal is to develop a working mobile application that allows users to scan a QR code and use the smartphone's camera to visualize a 3D model of an object. They will be able to follow a guide and complete
%! TODO

\section{What is my contribution?}
My contribution is applying my knowledge and experience to develop a mobile application that uses an AR module for displaying and interacting with the digital content and a QR code scanner module for scanning the QR codes, loading the 3D models and displaying them with the (AR) module.
