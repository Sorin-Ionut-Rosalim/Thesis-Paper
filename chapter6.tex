\section{Conclusion}
To sum up the results of the thesis, the Android application RealityEnhance meets the goals that were set at the beginning of the project. The application gives the user the power of enhanced perception of their surroundings by placing \ac{3D} models in the real world. The application has a simple and intuitive user interface that allows it to have many applications in a wide range of domains. It also shows the potential of \ac{AR} in the field of education. RealityEnhance can be used as a didactic tool for the teachers by allowing students to interact with the models in the \ac{AR} mode.

The application will be available for Android devices and it will be free to download from the Google Play Store. The application will also be available for IOS devices in the future. All the application code is available on GitHub\cite{RealityEnhance} and is open source.
